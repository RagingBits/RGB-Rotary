     Raging Bits RGB Rotary Windows Tool
_____________________________________________


 This tool has a 3 part composition to work:
    - "RagingBitsRGBRotaryTool.exe" as the tool runnable.
    - "_internal" as the dependencies needed for RagingBitsRGBRotaryTool.exe to run.
    - "animations" as the folder containing all the animations that can be uploaded 
      by the tool to the Rotary.

 This tool allows windows users to have a direct interface to the RGB Rotary module through a serial port.
 The tool allows the user to 
    - see the current rotary position,
    - set the intensity, 
    - update the autonomous animation.
    
 This tool has been generated by pyInstaller. 
 This means it may trigger your antivirus for a scan which is absolutely fine. Just let it finish the scan.

 The application comes with an "animations" folder loaded with the autonomous animation binaries available at dev time.
 For a more up to date list, please replace the content of "RGBRotary_windows_tool/animations" folder
with the content of "examples and animations" folder at the project base location.


 Have fun!
